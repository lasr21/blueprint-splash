	      <p><b>Who can attend?</b></p>
	      <p>Blueprint is for motivated high school students with a foundational computer science background.  This background could be from current enrollment or completion of an AP Computer Science class, or its equivalent (<a href="https://apstudent.collegeboard.org/apcourse/ap-computer-science-a/about-the-exam/java-subset">guidelines here</a>).
	      If you're not sure whether you qualify, we'll be posting a sample problem soon for you to solve.  If you can solve it, you should be good! If not, you might want to brush up on your skills so you can make the most of Blueprint.</p>
	      <p><b>When will applications open?</b></p>
	      <p>Applications open on January 1, 2016.</p>
	      <p><b>When will applications close?</b></p>
	      <p>Applications will close on February 1, 2016.</p>
	      <p><b>Does Blueprint cost money?</b></p>
	      <p>Nope!  We'll cover food, drinks, a Blueprint t-shirt, and an unforgettable experience :) We will not be reimbursing travel or overnight lodging, though.</p>
	      <p><b>Where is it? How do I get there?</b></p>
	      <p><a href="http://whereis.mit.edu/?go=32">The Ray and Maria Stata Center</a></b>, also known as Building 32, is in the northeast part of campus.  The address is <em>32 Vassar Street, Cambridge, MA 02139</em>.</p>
	      <p><b>What's the schedule?</b></p>
	      <p>We'll post the schedule to the website as soon as it's finalized, so check back later! In general, the learnathon will go from 9am to late afternoon, and the hackathon will go a bit longer. Blueprint is <b>not</b> an overnight event.</p>
	      <p><b>Do I have to come to both the learnathon and the hackathon?</b></p>
	      <p>Nope! You can attend either one or both days; just indicate so on your application.</p>
	      <p><b>What should I bring?</b></p>
	      <p>Bring a photo ID, a laptop (and its charger!), and your signed waiver.</p>
	      <p><b>What will I eat?</b></p>
	      <p>We'll provide food for all meals from Saturday's breakfast to Sunday's lunch. We'll do our best to accommodate all allergies and dietary restrictions as well.</p>
	      <p><b>What about overnight lodging?</b></p>
	      <p>Hotels near MIT include the <a href="http://www.kendallhotel.com/">Kendall Hotel</a> and the <a href="http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/boscb-boston-marriott-cambridge/">Marriott</a>. If needed, we can provide housing with MIT students on a case-by-case basis: contact us at <a href="mailto:blueprint@hackmit.org">blueprint@hackmit.org</a> and we'll discuss your specific situation.</p>
	      <p><b>How do teams work? What if I don't have a team?</b></p>
	      <p>Teams are a great way to meet new people or bond with friends, so we highly recommend them!  Don't worry if you don't have a team now; we'll have team formation and ideation sessions at the beginning of Blueprint so you can find some pals.</p>
	      <p><b>How does judging work?</b></p>
	      <p>You will have the opportunity to present your project to a panel of judges. In addition, you can exhibit your team's project and explore other creations at an end-of-the-day expo.</p>
	      <p><b>Are there any prizes?</b></p>
	      <p>Yep! Prizes have yet to be determined, but we promise a lot of them.</p>
	      <p><b>What about hardware hacking?</b></p>
	      <p>You're welcome to bring your own hardware (Arduinos, Raspberry Pis, etc.) to hack with!  Learnathon classes and mentors will specialize in software development, though.</p>
	      <p><b>What about parking?</b></p>
	      <p>Parking is free on a first-come, first-served basis on weekends in several lots: the <a href="http://whereis.mit.edu/?go=P40">65 Waverly Street Lot</a>, the <a href="http://whereis.mit.edu/?go=W98">W98 Lots</a>, the <a href="http://whereis.mit.edu/?go=P5">Hayward Street Lot</a>, and the <a href="http://whereis.mit.edu/?go=P34">W91 Lot</a>.  There is also some metered parking on Vassar Street.  MIT Facilities' list of pay lots near campus can be found <a href="http://web.mit.edu/facilities/transportation/parking/visitors/public_parking.html">here</a>.</p>
	      <p><b>Can my parents come with me?</b></p>
	      <p>Blueprint is a student-only event from check-in on, but your parents can tune in to our livestream! We're grateful for your parents' support of our program.</p>
	      <p><b>Wait... I can draw on the blue background?</b></p>
	      <p>:^)</p>
	      <p><b>What if I have questions that weren't answered here?</b></p>
	      <p>Please email us at <a href="mailto:blueprint@hackmit.org">blueprint@hackmit.org</a> with any questions or concerns!</p>
